  If instead you're ready to claim this bounty, <a href="https://www.bountyboard.makurspace.com/rest/claim_bounty/{bounty_id}">please click here, then submit some final images and any last notes about the job.</a>. If the bounty included mailing an item, be sure to include images of the package and shipping label as well as any tracking information.<br><br>

  Please note, this is not an examination! Our bounties don't have deadlines -- But they do require regular progress.
