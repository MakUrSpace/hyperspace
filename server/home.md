Stereolithography (SLA) and Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) are the two types of 3D printing that are popular in the professional and hobbyist additive manufacturing market.

SLA 3D printing uses a light reactive liquid "resin" that becomes a solid when exposed to ultraviolet wavelengths. An SLA 3D printer has a UV emitting LED set up that allows for an ultra precise level of detail across an array of complex geometries. The print is formed by each layer of the model being hardened by exposure to the UV emitter.

FDM 3D printing is done in a printer that melts a filament of thermoplastic and extrudes it layer by layer out of a precision print head. The beginning of the layer cools enough to harden by the time the next layer of the build is laid down.

Both methods of 3D printing require calibration and a varying degree of maintenance depending on their typical use. Both types of printing also create fumes that are non toxic but are also best kept filtered. Additive manufacturing also creates it's own physical waste that requires proper disposal to avoid environmental contamination.

MakUrSpace's bespoke 3D printing workstations, with "Automated Craftsman" integration will, with minimal effort, guide any experience level user through the hardware/printer setup and calibration required to see their print made real. MUS workstations reduce the trial and error of additive manufacturing by removing machine settings and maintenance from the list of potential failures.

Any individual can have a relationship with their 3D printer. At MakUrSpace, we want to provide our community with the tools to have a relationship with their creative manufacturing potential. With a dedicated community to teach, learn, request, and fulfill any user's additive manufacturing needs, knowledge is built into a MakUrSpace community make space.

At MakUrSpace we are not and pinky promise not to be evil. A rising tide floats all ships, and distributing additive manufacturing to the masses is the first of our many goals to improving our community.
